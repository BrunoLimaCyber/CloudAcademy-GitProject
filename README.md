 CloudAcademy-GitProject

I created this repository for a project. The project was to create a new repository with a bash CLI by connecting an SSH key to Github.

Through the connection, I used the bash command line on VSCode to create this current repository on Github.

I created a new branch titled main. Then created a README file and pushed it into the repository.
